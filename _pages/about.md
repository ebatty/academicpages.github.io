I'm currently a lecturer/curriculum developer for computational neuroscience for the Harvard PhD Program in Neuroscience. Former PhD student in the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience at Columbia University. My research focuses on machine learning approaches to develop better encoding and decoding models for neural responses. Other interests include developing better methods for understanding complex networks (both biological and artificial), computational neuroscience education, and dogs.
