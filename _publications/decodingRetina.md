Abstract: Decoding sensory stimuli from neural signals can be used to reveal how we sense
our physical environment, and is valuable for the design of brain-machine interfaces.
However, existing linear techniques for neural decoding may not fully reveal or exploit
the fidelity of the neural signal. Here we develop a new approximate Bayesian
method for decoding natural images from the spiking activity of populations of
retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). We sidestep known computational challenges with
Bayesian inference by exploiting artificial neural networks developed for computer
vision, enabling fast nonlinear decoding that incorporates natural scene statistics
implicitly. We use a decoder architecture that first linearly reconstructs an image
from RGC spikes, then applies a convolutional autoencoder to enhance the image.
The resulting decoder, trained on natural images and simulated neural responses,
significantly outperforms linear decoding, as well as simple point-wise nonlinear
decoding. These results provide a tool for the assessment and optimization of retinal
prosthesis technologies, and reveal that the retina may provide a more accurate
representation of the visual scene than previously appreciated.
